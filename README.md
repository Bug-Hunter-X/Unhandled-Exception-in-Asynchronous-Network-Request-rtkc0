# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Network Request

This example demonstrates a common Dart coding issue: neglecting to handle exceptions that might occur during an asynchronous network request.  The `fetchData` function attempts to retrieve JSON data from a remote API.  However, the original code lacks robust error handling and logging. 

The solution addresses this by adding more detailed error handling and logging to facilitate better debugging and provide more informative error messages to the user.
